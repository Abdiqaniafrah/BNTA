package com.bnta.interfaces;

public class Car {
    // example car, bicycle ,scooter
    // move()
    // break()
    // speed()
    // how the car or bicycle move will be different so the method
    // implementation will be different but the class will be the same
    // implementation will be different for all types
    // create interface from the package and call it vehicle
    // add all the classes we have and the benchmark is that all vehicle must
    // be able to move, apply breaks and get current speed.
    // interface does not need public or method body
    // specification are - be able to move, apply breaks and get current speed.
    // must implement all the specification in the public class section
    // syntax is implements Vehicle
    // different implementation eg. car you start the engine, bike you peddle
    // private List <Vehicle> vehicles; - person can have all types of vehicles
